<div id="ab1"><p>ProGym's has been the authority on fitness since 1965. 
It was then that fitness legend Joe Pro took the knowledge and expertise he gained from training at the world famous "Muscle Beach" 
and opened up the first Pro's Gym on Pacific Avenue in Venice, California.
Opened long before the modern day health club existed, the original Pro's Gym featured homemade equipment and an unrivaled dedication to getting results.
It was an instant hit. Early fitness enthusiasts flocked to the gym, and in 1977, Pro's Gym received international attention from "Pumping Iron"
-a bodybuilding documentary starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferrigno. With its storied reputation of being the place to go for the latest 
training techniques, and its legendary history of producing bodybuilding champions, Pro's Gym Venice became known as "The Mecca Of Bodybuilding."
Hollywood celebrities and professional athletes soon followed and by 1980, Pro's Gym began expanding to locations around the globe.</div>
